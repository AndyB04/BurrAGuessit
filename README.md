// Peer Reviewed by : Rafael Manzo, The program didn't run for me, It looks like you have it almost all there to work just missing afew key components, I would suggest taking a look at others code then going into code academy, open sylabus and open cheat sheet, from there you can read the specifics on how to make sure you have everything you need for your code to run. Once feel better i would come back to this one. Other wise good job gettting almost all of it, i understand it can be challenging at times.
